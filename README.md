A Matrix server, forked from Dendrite before the license change and CLA.

Versus Dendrite and Synapse, Maidtrix (silly tentative name) will be focusing on smaller deployments. Docker and Helm are removed from the repository; the focus will be on single-server deployments for now.

Some goals in the short-term include adding more testing, adding support for newer Matrix features, and adding features to allow for database portability between other Matrix servers.
